## Contributing Articles

If you'd like to contribute an article, you can write about your own NBA data experiments, visualizations, or any relevant sports analytics topic. Articles are written in Markdown (`.md`) and placed in the `/_posts` or `/content/blog` directory.

### Frontmatter Template

Every article must begin with the following metadata block:

```md
---
title: "Your Article Title"
excerpt: "A short one-liner summary of your article's insight or result."
coverImage: "/assets/blog/your_folder_name/your_image.jpg"
date: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ"
author:
  name: Your Name
  picture: "/assets/blog/authors/your_photo.jpg"
ogImage:
  url: "/assets/blog/your_folder_name/your_image.jpg"
---
```

### Content Guidelines

1. **Title & Excerpt**: Keep it clear and engaging. The excerpt appears as a preview.
2. **Cover Image**: Store under `/public/assets/blog/your_folder_name/`.
3. **Date**: Use ISO 8601 format.
4. **Author**: Add your name and profile image under `/public/assets/blog/authors/`.
5. **OG Image**: Usually the same as the cover image.

### Example Directory Structure

```
/public
  /assets
    /blog
      /your_folder_name
        your_image.jpg
